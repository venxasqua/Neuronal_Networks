# Neuronal_Networks
This is my first learning project to Neuronal Network.

There is some thing Iwant to say here.

First, my Neuronal network can be used for Multi-class Classification.
Here, I use Softmax Regression. For each layer I use Logistic Regression, so if you want to use max(x,0) then you need just to change the derivative and set to 1 if x>0.

You also can improve the program by normalize each layer and do batch gradient descent, but dont use stochastic descent, since you will lose the vectorize programming.
