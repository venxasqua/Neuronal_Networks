# Neuronal_Networks
This is my first learning project to Neuronal Network.

There is some thing Iwant to say here.

First, my Neuronal network can be used for Multi-class Classification.
Here, I used one vs all. So if you want to recognize c number of classes, then Y_train is a (m,1) dimensional matrix, where m is the training size, and Y_train has values between 0 and c-1. 
Note here that the last layer (out-put layer) will have only c-1 neurons, so that if the acitivision function of the last layer is to low, then this belong to the first class.
